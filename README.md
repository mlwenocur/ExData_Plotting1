## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, I used the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which is available on
the course web site.

### Operating Instructions
*To generate the plots do the following:*

1. Download *household\_power\_consumption.txt* to where you wish to output the plot files.
2. Set working directory to that containing *household\_power\_consumption.txt*. For example,
setwd('bigDataStudies/Data Science Specialization JHU/ExData_Plotting1/')
3. Source GetDataSet.R, plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, 
   plot4.R, eg,  source('~/bigDataStudies/plot4.R')
4. DoPlot1();DoPlot2();DoPlot3();DoPlot4()


### Operational Requirements
I have not optimized memory usage when reading
in the data by creating a temporary file with only the needed data. *Consequently my program requires approximately twenty megs of ram to execute.*
